To run the code, you need Anaconda installed on your machine. 
Create the conda environment with all the necessary packages with 
the following command:

$ conda env create -f environment.yml

Then, open main.ipynb (preferably in vscode) and select the 'imu_data_processing' 
conda environment as your kernel.
